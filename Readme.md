# ðŸš€ Getting started with Blog app

I have Build a Blog App where user can Regiester/Login and CRUD/Like/Comment Blog Posts.
I have used Vite module bundler for this project.
Redux is used for State management.
Material UI v4 is used for Styling.

### `install client`

Installation of client may also require a flag of --legacy-peer-deps as I have used Material UI version 4 with JSS and current version is v5 with emotion.

```
cd client
npm install if not npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### `install Server`

Installation of server

```
cd server
npm install
```

### `start`

On Terminal type below command:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

### `start`

On Terminal type below command:

```
cd server
npm start
```
